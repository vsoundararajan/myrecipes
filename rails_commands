When ever you need authentication:

Add 
  gem 'bcrypt', '3.1.7'
  to Gemfile

run 
  bundle install

and in the model add 
   has_secure_password

And in database add a column named password_digest :string

model.password = 'saasd' to set it
model.authenticate('password') returns model object if it is correct. Elese returns false.
